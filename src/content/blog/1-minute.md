If the person you're talking to is busy and/or don't have a lot of time on their hands one question you probably should be asking yourself is "What's the 1 minute version of it?". It's a really good exercise that forces you to be succinct.

How **NOT** to do it:

- Speak fast
- Open parentheses/Get into details

How to do it:

- Stick to three ideas/elements at most
- Write [it] beforehand
- Leave the most important thing/element/idea last OR Lead with it
